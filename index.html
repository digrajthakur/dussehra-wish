            <summary>History  Of  Dussehra</summary>
            <p>
                The Hindu epic Ramayana, which tells the story of Lord Rama, the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, killing the ten-headed monster
                <br>
                Ravana in the Sat-yuga after Ravana kidnapped Lord Rama's wife Sita, is the origin of the Dussehra festival

            With the assistance of his
                <br>
                brother Lakshman and his devotee Hanuman, Lord Rama travelled all the way to Lanka (Ravana's realm) in order to confront Ravana
                <br>
                and win Sita back. In order to receive the protection of the goddess of courage and strength, Rama prayed to Durga while they were on
                <br>
                the journey. Finally, Lord Rama defeated evil by killing Ravana. To commemorate this day, people mark Vijayadashami or the Dussehra
                <br>
                festival, and Dussehra celebrations are held all around the country.
